# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Flow is a visual workflow automation tool designed to help small teams, freelancers, and remote professionals automate repetitive email-to-task workflows without coding. The MVP focuses on connecting Gmail with task management tools (Trello/Asana) through a drag-and-drop visual interface using React Flow, enhanced by AI assistance for pattern recognition and workflow optimization.

## Visual Storyboard Reference

The complete visual storyboard and user experience flow is documented in `docs/storyboard.md` and `docs/features.md`. Key UI components include:

1. **Dashboard View** - Workflow management and creation entry point
2. **Canvas Editor** - React Flow-based drag-and-drop interface with node library
3. **Node Configuration** - Side panel for configuring triggers, actions, and AI nodes
4. **Workflow Testing** - Run/test functionality with visual feedback
5. **Template System** - Pre-built workflows for quick setup

## MVP Scope (1-Week Build)

The MVP prioritizes React Flow integration with these core features:
- Drag-and-drop node placement (Triggers, Actions, Logic, AI)
- Visual node connections with validation
- Node configuration panels
- Basic workflow execution and testing
- Template workflows for onboarding

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a freelance consultant, I want to authenticate with my email and task management accounts, so that I can securely connect my workflows to the services I use daily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL provide OAuth login options for Gmail, Trello, and Asana
2. WHEN a user completes OAuth authentication THEN the system SHALL store secure access tokens and display connection status
3. WHEN a user's OAuth token expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication and handle token refresh automatically
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retry options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a remote professional, I want to create visual workflows using drag-and-drop nodes, so that I can automate email-to-task processes without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the workflow editor THEN the system SHALL display a visual canvas with available trigger and action nodes
2. WHEN a user drags a "New Email" trigger node onto the canvas THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of email filtering criteria (subject, sender, keywords)
3. WHEN a user drags a "Create Task" action node onto the canvas THEN the system SHALL allow selection of target board/project and task template configuration
4. WHEN a user connects nodes on the canvas THEN the system SHALL visually represent the workflow flow and validate connections
5. WHEN a user saves a workflow THEN the system SHALL persist the configuration and make it available for activation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a small agency team member, I want AI assistance to suggest workflow patterns and auto-tag content, so that I can optimize my automation setup efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new workflow THEN the system SHALL suggest common workflow patterns based on connected services
2. WHEN processing email content THEN the system SHALL analyze subject and body text to suggest relevant tags and categorization
3. WHEN email content mentions budget amounts over $5,000 THEN the system SHALL automatically apply "High Priority" tags
4. WHEN a workflow runs multiple times THEN the system SHALL learn patterns and suggest optimizations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a freelancer, I want to monitor my active workflows and debug issues, so that I can ensure my automation is working correctly and troubleshoot problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display workflow status indicators (running, failed, paused)
2. WHEN a workflow executes THEN the system SHALL log execution details including timestamps, processed data, and results
3. WHEN a user clicks on workflow debug THEN the system SHALL show the last 10 execution logs with detailed information
4. WHEN a workflow fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and suggested resolution steps
5. WHEN a user requests workflow health status THEN the system SHALL display uptime, success rate, and last execution time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a remote professional, I want my workflows to execute automatically in the background, so that I can focus on my core work while automation handles routine tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user activates a workflow THEN the system SHALL begin monitoring the configured email triggers
2. WHEN a new email matches workflow criteria THEN the system SHALL execute the configured actions within 5 minutes
3. WHEN processing emails THEN the system SHALL extract relevant data (subject, body, sender) and map it to task fields
4. WHEN creating tasks in external systems THEN the system SHALL handle API rate limits and retry failed requests
5. WHEN workflow execution completes THEN the system SHALL update execution logs and notify users of results

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a small team member, I want a responsive interface that works on mobile devices, so that I can monitor and manage my workflows from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface optimized for touch interaction
2. WHEN viewing workflows on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide simplified views while maintaining core functionality
3. WHEN a user needs to modify workflows on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide touch-friendly editing capabilities
4. WHEN notifications are triggered THEN the system SHALL display mobile-optimized alerts and status updates

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user setting up automation for the first time, I want to complete onboarding in under 2 minutes, so that I can quickly start benefiting from workflow automation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user signs up THEN the system SHALL provide a guided onboarding flow with clear steps
2. WHEN a user completes account connections THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest a starter workflow template
3. WHEN a user follows the onboarding process THEN the system SHALL enable them to create their first working workflow within 2 minutes
4. WHEN onboarding is complete THEN the system SHALL provide quick access to help documentation and support resources
