# PRD Implementation Planning Guide

## Core Responsibilities
When analyzing PRDs and creating implementation plans:

### Analysis Phase
- Extract all features and categorize by priority (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have)
- Identify technical requirements, constraints, and dependencies
- Determine feature complexity and implementation scope
- Map features to frontend, backend, or full-stack requirements

### Technology Selection
- Research current best practices for the project scale and requirements
- Select appropriate tech stack considering performance, scalability, and team expertise
- Provide official documentation links for all recommended technologies
- Justify technology choices with clear reasoning

### Implementation Structure
Organize work into four logical stages:
1. **Foundation & Setup** - Environment, architecture, infrastructure
2. **Core Features** - Essential functionality and main user flows  
3. **Advanced Features** - Complex functionality and integrations
4. **Polish & Optimization** - Testing, performance, and deployment prep

### Task Planning
- Create broad, actionable sub-steps (avoid micro-tasks)
- Use `- [ ]` checkbox format for all tasks
- Include realistic time estimates and dependencies
- Focus on deliverable outcomes rather than individual commits

## Documentation Requirements

### Standard Output Structure
When creating implementation plans, include:
- Feature analysis with priority categorization
- Recommended tech stack with official documentation links
- Four-stage implementation breakdown with checkboxes
- Realistic time estimates and dependencies

### Documentation Files
Create three interconnected documents in `/docs`:
- `implementation.md` - Complete implementation plan with stages and tasks
- `project_structure.md` - Folder hierarchy and file organization patterns
- `ui_ux_doc.md` - Design system, component guidelines, and user flows

### Quality Standards
- Provide official documentation links for all technologies
- Use realistic time estimates considering team expertise
- Include testing and quality assurance in each stage
- Ensure consistency across all documentation files
- Focus on deliverable outcomes and actionable tasks
